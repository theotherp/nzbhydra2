  This seems to be the first time that you started NZBHydra 2.
  <br><br> If you're already using NZBHydra 1 (python based) you can <a href="#" ng-click="startMigration()">migrate your data</a>.
  <br><br> If you're a new user (or don't want to migrate your data right now) you can start by <a href="#" ng-click="goToConfig()">configuring NZBHydra 2</a>.
  <br> You will not be able to use it until you've added at least one indexer.
  <br><br> If you're stuck you can refer to <a href="https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra2/wiki">the wiki</a> or the online help (available from the config).<br> If you haven't found an answer there you're welcome to <a href="https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra2/issues">raise a GitHub issue</a>  or create a thread on reddit.
