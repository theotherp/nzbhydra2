      So you found a bug? Ideally <a href="https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra2/issues/new" target="_blank">raise an issue on github</a>. If you don't have an account create one ;-) Otherwise
      <a href="mailto:theotherp@gmx.de">send me a mail</a>.<br>
      <b>But</b> please read this first:<br> Don't just tell me what the problem is. If you just post an exception from the console or say "x does not work" I probably won't be willing or able to help. Remember you want something from me.
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tell me what you expect to happen and what actually happens
        </li>
        <li>
          If hydra doesn't even start, tell me your OS and how you start it.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the website looks weird tell me what browser you use. If you use a reverse proxy post your config and your base URL setting.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the GUI behaves strangely or doesn't react as it should check the browser console for errors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Tell me anything that might help. If you do all that I will do my best to help you and improve NZBHydra.

      <br><br> If possible provide the log and your settings. Here you can get anonymized versions of both to be posted:<br>

      You may want to take a look at the settings to make sure there's nothing in there you wouldn't want me to see.
